Context and initial Project Description
The original experiments were performed with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The smartphone used its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments can be viewed at the following URL (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A)

Tidy Data Set Structure
The Tidy Data Set resulting from the execution of run_analysis.R contains 68  variables.
The first 2 are identifiers for the activity performed and the subject_id.
There were 30 subjects in the experiments so ids are in [1-30] range.
Activities are the following and were coded as given in parenthesis in the original data set (see Credits below):
* WALKING (1)
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (2)
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (3)
* SITTING (4)
* STANDING (5)
* LAYING (6)
The following 66 columns are measures of mean or standard deviation for each activity and each subjects (ie. they have been computed from orginal measures by aggregating by activity and subject then applying the mean).
Below is the list of all 66 measures:
1. timeBodyAcceleration-mean-X
2. timeBodyAcceleration-mean-Y
3. timeBodyAcceleration-mean-Z
4. timeBodyAcceleration-stdDev-X

* Units are in radian/second for time measures, in hertz for frequency measures

Tidy Data Set Content
The data set contents 180 observations (6 activities x 30 subjects) of the 66 variables (means of each average and standard deviation) from the original UCI HAR dataset.
The first line of the file consists of the header with the variables names.
